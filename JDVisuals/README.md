# JD Visuals Application

This directory encapsulates the application which actually makes use of the JD Visuals library. This is where the primary goal is based around: a simple application which provides numerous visuals for a user to play. 

## NOTE

This application is still not perfect, and is still due for an overhaul. This might even become a Screen Saver, although those have lately become a thing of the past. Nonetheless, this application is simply meant to demonstrate the ability to write simple and advanced visuals. It's more or less just an experiment. And this is the application where I get to actually see what I've written. 

## NOTE

The order in which the visuals are sorted within the main Visualization drop-down box corresponds with the order in which each visual unit is "used" by this project. These units are explicitly added to the project, and you must change the order of the uses in the main project file in order to manipulate the order in the main drop-down.
