# JD Visuals
Visualization Engine in Delphi

## Summary

This project is more of an experiment to play around with, as well as learn a bit about graphics and multithreading. It encapsulates a simple visualization engine which allows you to incorporate your own visuals, and switch between them. Each visual provides different controls to the user to change how the animation works.

## Prerequisites / Technology

 - Written on Delphi 10.1 Berlin but should work fine on other recent versions
 - [Jedi library](https://www.delphi-jedi.org/), specifically the JCL for its Spin Edit control
 - GDI+ library which is built-in to Delphi (`GDIPAPI` and `GDIPOBJ`) units
 - VCL Styles which is built-in to Delphi

## Setup

Currently, this project is very raw, but functional. It includes a component package which you must install in order to drop the custom control into your form in the IDE. The application also requires the JEDI component library as mentioned above.
